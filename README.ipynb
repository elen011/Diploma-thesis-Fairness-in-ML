    "**Thesis Project ‚Äì [2025]*\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository contains the code developed during my thesis, focusing on fairness-aware regression using synthetic and real datasets. It includes implementations of OLS, soft constraints, NDLR (Non-Discriminatory Linear Regression), and QNDLR (Quasi NDLR) with various fairness metrics and optimization approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Reproducibility Notice**:  \n",
    "> NDLR, QNDLR, and their variants are **stochastic**. Their outputs vary slightly across runs.  \n",
    "> To reproduce the **exact results** from the thesis, **do not re-run** the corresponding cells.  \n",
    "> Pre-generated output files are included.\n",
